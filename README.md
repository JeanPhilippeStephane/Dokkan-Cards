# DokkanCards

## What's this project about?

This project is a side-tool -mobile- application for the actual mobile game "Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle".It's purpose is to educate the players of the game about the various cards and events.To achieve this, this app will include a complete card database consisting of every available in-game card and it's details(stats,passive skills,super attacks etc.).

## What's this project's purpose?

Being a Dragon Ball fan myself for many many years, i started playing "Dokkan Battle" as soon as it came out.While more and more cards were coming out i realised that i wanted to see the details for a card that i do not own, thus finding various online websites like ***dbz.space*** , ***dokkan wiki*** etc. that did that. Later on however, i also realised that a lot of users including myself wanted to have access to those details while not connecting to the internet.Here's where **Dokkan Cards** comes into place with it's offline card database and it's plethora of features.


## What features will it provide to the users?

### 1. It's FREE & doesn't require an intenret connection

2. A main page, inside of which each user will be able to:
   * See all available cards 
   - Sort the card database using various filters
   - Use filters to show only some specific cards
   - Search any card in the database
   - Tap on a card's icon to view it's details
   - Long-tap on a card's icon to add it to either their *User Box (GLB)* or *User Box (JP)*
   
3. A *User Box(GLB)* and a *User Box(JP)* page, within which each user will be able to :

   - See all the cards that they own on their Global & JP Accounts respectively(**You must add them first manually from the main page**)
   - Remove cards
   - Sort their card box
   - Search for any card in their box
   
4. An *Events* page where every user will be able to see various event details like medals,character drops etc.
